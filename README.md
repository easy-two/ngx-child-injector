Child injectors without lazy-loading or RouterModule
-

Sometimes you don't need lazy-loading or you have to split up your application not by routes (which are rather big), but into smaller parts. This package could help you there.

This repo contains two packages: [`ngx-child-injector`](projects/child-injector/README.md) and [`ngx-child-injector-transformer`](projects/child-injector-transformer/README.md).
You can read README's in of that packages in their directories in `projects/*` dir.

This code is part of [an article](https://blog.angularindepth.com/requests-tracking-in-angular-application-with-child-module-injectors-without-lazy-loading-7227bd01d97a) in AngularInDepth.
